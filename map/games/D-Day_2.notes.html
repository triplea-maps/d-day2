An Allied part (A1, A2, etc.), A German part (G1, G2, etc.) and a part for Fighter  patrol (P1, P2, etc.). They all count as one territory together. <br>  <br>-If opposing units occupy the same territory ALL of them have to move into combat at the enemy part of the territory and fight.   <br>  <br>-If opposing units occupy the same territory NONE are allowed to leave it until one side wins the battle(Air-units excluded). Reinforcements however are allowed. <br>  <br>-No more than 8 units of one alliance are allowed in the same territory at any time(Air-units and blockhouses excluded). <br>  <br>-Allied victory is achieved when they take and CLEAR the three cities for 1 whole round before the end of turn 10. Else they loose. <br>  <br>-No new units can enter the game except for the reinforcements indicated. <br> <br> <br> <br>UNITS: <br> <br>Allies: <br> <br>-Infantry:           Att=1, Def=2, Move=1(5) <br>-Artillery:          Att=2, Def=2, Move=1(5), do not support inf. <br>-Armor:              Att=3, Def=2, Move=2(7) <br>-Bomber:             Att=3, move=30, makes targeted attack <br>-1xFighter: (=AA)    Att=1, move=30, patrol territory for enemy movement  <br>-2xFighter: (=AA)    Att=2, move=30, patrol territory for enemy movement <br>-3xFighter: (=AA)    Att=3, move=30, patrol territory for enemy movement <br>-Naval Bombardement: Att=2, =suicide, attack only Blockhouses <br>-ParaSurprise:       Att=1, =suicide <br> <br>Germans: <br> <br>-Infantry:           Att=1, Def=2, Move=1(5) <br>-Artillery:          Att=2, Def=2, Move=1(5), do not support inf., act also as AA <br>-Armor:!!!
